# Hanoi puzzle
The **Tower of Hanoi** is a classic mathematical puzzle that can be solved using both **loop-based** and **recursive** approaches. Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows solving complex computational problems with minimal code.  

## Overview
The puzzle consists of **three rods** and a number of **disks of different diameters**. The objective is to move all disks from the **first rod** to the **third rod**, following these strict rules:  

1. **Only the topmost disk can be moved at any time.**  
2. **Only one disk can be moved per step.**  
3. **A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.**  

## Features  

Implements both **loop-based** and **recursive** solutions.  
Follows the fundamental **Tower of Hanoi rules**.  
Helps understand **recursion** and **algorithmic problem-solving**.
