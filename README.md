# Hanoi puzzle
A loop-based approach is used to solve the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then how to implement a recursive solution. Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.

## Overview
The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters. The goal of this puzzle is moving the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following specific rules that restrict placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
